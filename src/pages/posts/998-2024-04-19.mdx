    ReactJS stands tall as a go-to tool in front-end development, loved for its
    code foundation and lively community. What really draws me to React is its
    dedicated team and the passionate support from its users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The future of React is bright and full of possibilities. If I had to sum it
    up, I'd say it's all about doing more with less.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this article, I'll talk about what's new in React 19 so you can dive into
    the changes and explore its features.
  </p>
  <p>
    But remember, React 19 is still a work in progress. Stay updated by checking
    the official guide on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" className="link">GitHub</a>
    and following the team on social media.

<h2 className="secondary-title mt-8">ü™ù Enhanced hooks</h2>
<p>
  React Hooks have been one of the most loved features introduced in the
  library. You have likely used React's built-in hooks many times, and perhaps
  you've tried making your own custom hooks, too. Hooks are so popular that
  they've become a React programming pattern.
</p>

<p>
  In React 19, the way we use useMemo, forwardRef, useEffect, and useContext
  will change. This is mainly because a new hook, use, will be introduced.
</p>

<h2>ü•Å useMemo()</h2>
<p>
  You won't need to use the useMemo() hook after React 19, as React Compiler
  will memoize by itself.
</p>

<h3>Before:</h3>
```jsx import React, {(useState, useMemo)} from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

// Memoize the result of checking if the input value is empty
const isInputEmpty = useMemo(() => {
console.log('Checking if input is empty...');
return inputValue.trim() === '';
}, [inputValue]);

return (
<div>
<input
type="text"
value={inputValue}
onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
placeholder="Type something..."
/>
<p>{isInputEmpty ? 'Input is empty' : 'Input is not empty'}</p>
</div>
);
}

````

<h3>After:</h3>
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const isInputEmpty = () => {
    console.log('Checking if input is empty...');
    return inputValue.trim() === '';
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type something..."
      />
      <p>{isInputEmpty ? 'Input is empty' : 'Input is not empty'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
````

<h2>ü•Å forwardRef()</h2>
<p>
  Ref will be now passed as props rather than using the forwardRef() hook. This
  will simplify the code. So after React 19, you won't need to use forwardRef().
</p>

<h3>Before:</h3>
```jsx import React, {forwardRef} from 'react';

const ExampleButton = forwardRef((props, ref) => (

{" "}
<button ref={ref}>{props.children}</button>
)); ```

<h3>After:</h3>
```jsx import React from 'react';

const ExampleButton = ({ ref, children }) => (

{" "}
<button ref={ref}>{children}</button>
); ```
<h2>ü•Å The new use() hook</h2>
<p>
  React19 will introduce a new hook called use(). This hook will simplify how we
  use promises, async code, and context.
</p>

<p>Here is the syntax of the hook:</p>
<pre>
  <code>const value = use(resource);</code>
</pre>

<p>
  The following example demonstrates how to use the use hook to make a fetch
  request:
</p>

```jsx
import { use } from "react";

const fetchUsers = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
  return res.json();
};

const UsersItems = () => {
  const users = use(fetchUsers());

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <div key={user.id} className="bg-blue-50 shadow-md p-4 my-6 rounded-lg">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">{user.name}</h2>
          <p>{user.email}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
export default UsersItems;
```

<p>Lets explain this code:</p>
<p>
  <code>fetchUsers()</code> handles the GET request.
</p>
<p>
  We utilize the <code>use()</code> hook to execute <code>fetchUsers()</code>{" "}
  instead of employing the useEffect or useState hooks.
</p>
<p>
  The return value of the useState hook, <code>users</code>, contains the
  response of the GET request (users).
</p>
<p>
  In the return block, <code>users</code> is mapped over to create the list.
</p>

<p>
  Now, instead of <code>useContext()</code>, we will have{" "}
  <code>use(context)</code> for managing global states with the Context API
</p>
```jsx import {(createContext, useState, use)} from 'react';

const CustomThemeContext = createContext();

const CustomThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
const [currentTheme, setCurrentTheme] = useState('light');

const changeTheme = () => {
setCurrentTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
};

return (
<CustomThemeContext.Provider value={{ currentTheme, changeTheme }}>
{children}
</CustomThemeContext.Provider>
);
};

const CustomCard = () => {
// Custom use Hook()
const { currentTheme, changeTheme } = use(CustomThemeContext);

return (
<div
className={`p-4 rounded-md ${
        currentTheme === 'light' ? 'bg-white' : 'bg-gray-800'
      }`} >
<h1
className={`my-4 text-xl ${
          currentTheme === 'light' ? 'text-gray-800' : 'text-white'
        }`} >
Theme Card
</h1>
<p className={currentTheme === 'light' ? 'text-gray-800' : 'text-white'}>
Hello!! use() hook
</p>
<button
        onClick={changeTheme}
        className='bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-md mt-4 p-4'
      >
{currentTheme === 'light' ? 'Switch to Dark Mode' : 'Switch to Light Mode'}
</button>
</div>
);
};

const CustomTheme = () => {
return (
<CustomThemeProvider>
<CustomCard />
</CustomThemeProvider>
);
};

export default CustomTheme;

````

<h2>ü•Å The useFormStatus() Hook</h2>

<p>This new hook in React19 provides enhanced control over the forms you create, offering status information about the last form submission.</p>

<p>Here's the syntax:</p>

```jsx
const { isPending, formData, method, action } = useFormStatus();
````

<p>or the simplified version:</p>
```jsx const {status} = useFormStatus() ```
<p>Let's delve into its functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>isPending</strong>: Indicates if the form is currently pending
    submission; true if pending, false otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>formData</strong>: An object implementing the FormData interface
    containing the data the parent &lt;form&gt; is submitting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>method</strong>: The HTTP method ‚Äì GET or POST. Defaults to GET.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>action</strong>: A reference to a function.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This hook facilitates displaying a pending state and the submitted data from
  the user.
</p>
<p>Here's a code example:</p>
```jsx

import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";

function SubmitButton() {
const { isPending } = useFormStatus();
return <button disabled={isPending}>{isPending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}</button>;
}

const formSubmitAction = async () => {
// Simulate a delay of 2 seconds
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
}

const FormStatus = () => {
return (
<form action={formSubmitAction}>
<SubmitButton />
</form>
);
};

export default FormStatus;
```
<p>Here's the breakdown of the code:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SubmitButton</strong> is a component responsible for the form submission action. It retrieves the submission status using <code>useFormStatus()</code> and disables the button accordingly.</li>
  <li>Based on the <strong>isPending</strong> status, the appropriate message is displayed in the UI.</li>
  <li><strong>formSubmitAction</strong> is a simulated function to delay the form submission.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ü•Å The useCustomFormState() Hook</h2>

<p>
  Another new hook in React19 is useCustomFormState. It allows you to update
  state based on the result of a form submission.
</p>

<p>Here's the syntax:</p>

```jsx
const [customState, customFormAction] = useCustomFormState(submitHandler, initialState, permalink?);
```

<p>
  <strong>submitHandler</strong>: the function to be called when the form is
  submitted or button is pressed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>initialState</strong>: the value you want the state to be initially.
  It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is
  first invoked.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>permalink</strong>: this is optional. A URL or page link, if
  submitHandler is going to be run on server then the page will redirect to
  permalink.
</p>
<p>This hook will return:</p>
<p>
  <strong>customState</strong>: the initial state will be the value we have
  passed to initialState.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>customFormAction</strong>: an action that will be passed to the form
  action. The return value of this will be available in the state.
</p>
<p>Here's an example of how it works:</p>

```jsx
import { useCustomFormState } from "react-dom";

const CustomFormState = () => {
  const customSubmitHandler = (prevState, formData) => {
    const name = formData.get("username");
    console.log(prevState); // previous form state
    if (name === "john") {
      return {
        success: true,
        text: "Welcome",
      };
    } else {
      return {
        success: false,
        text: "Error",
      };
    }
  };
  const [message, customFormAction] = useCustomFormState(
    customSubmitHandler,
    null
  );
  return (
    <form action={customFormAction}>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" />
      <button>Submit</button>
      {message && <h1>{message.text}</h1>}
    </form>
  );
};

export default CustomFormState;
```

<p>Here's the breakdown of the code:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>customSubmitHandler</strong> is the method responsible for the form submission. This is the Action (remember Action new React19 feature).</li>
  <li>Inside <strong>customSubmitHandler</strong>, we are checking the value of the form. Then, depending on whether it's successful or shows an error, we return the specific value and message. In the above code example, if there is any value other than "John", then it will return an error.</li>
  <li>We can also check the <strong>prevState</strong> of the form. The initial state would be null, and after that, it will return the prevState of the form.</li>
</ul>
<p>On running this example, you will see a "welcome" message if the name is John ‚Äì otherwise, it will return "error".</p>
<h2>ü•Å The useCustomOptimistic() Hook</h2>

<p>useCustomOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you show a different state while an async action is underway, according to the React docs.</p>

<p>This hook will help enhance the user experience and should result in faster responses. This will be useful for applications that need to interact with the server.</p>

<p>Here's the syntax of the useCustomOptimistic hook:</p>

```jsx
const [customOptimisticState, customAddOptimisticState] = useCustomOptimistic(state, updateFn)
```
<p>For example, while a response is on the way, we can show a "state" to give the user an immediate response. Once the actual response is returned from the server, the "optimistic" state will be replaced by it.</p>
<p>The useCustomOptimistic hook will immediately update the UI assuming the request will succeed. The name is "optimistic" because the user will see the optimistic (success) result of performing an action, even though the action actually takes time to complete.</p>
<p>Let's look at how we can implement the useCustomOptimistic hook. The below code shows the optimistic state on click of the button submit  &lt;form input&gt; (Sending...) until the response doesn't come.</p>
```jsx
import { useCustomOptimistic, useState } from "react";

const CustomOptimistic = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([
    { text: "Hey, I am initial!", sending: false, key: 1 },
  ]);
  const [optimisticMessages, addCustomOptimisticMessage] = useCustomOptimistic(
    messages,
    (state, newMessage) => [
      ...state,
      {
        text: newMessage,
        sending: true,
      },
    ]
  );

  async function sendFormData(formData) {
    const sentMessage = await fakeDelayAction(formData.get("message"));
    setMessages((messages) => [...messages, { text: sentMessage }]);
  }

  async function fakeDelayAction(message) {
    await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1000));
    return message;
  }

  const submitData = async (userData) => {
    addCustomOptimisticMessage(userData.get("username"));

    await sendFormData(userData);
  };

  return (
    <>
      {optimisticMessages.map((message, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          {message.text}
          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form action={submitData}>
        <h1>CustomOptimisticState Hook</h1>
        <div>
          <label>Username</label>
          <input type="text" name="username" />
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
};

export default CustomOptimistic;
```
<p>Here's the breakdown of the code:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>fakeDelayAction</strong> is a fake method to delay the submit event. This is to show the optimistic state.</li>
  <li><strong>submitData</strong> is the action. This method is responsible for the form submission. This could be async, too.</li>
  <li><strong>sendFormData</strong> is responsible for sending the form to fakeDelayAction</li>
  <li>Setting the default state. messages will be used in the useCustomOptimistic() as input and will return in optimisticMessages.</li>
</ul>
